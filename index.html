<h3>About me</h3>

<p>This is my first time using GitHub and i can&#39;t upload PDF files yet as i am a <strong>小笨蛋</strong> who only konws LaTeX,so I am still learning</p>

<p>I am a <strong>数学名词党</strong>.But I wanted to quit the party, so I spent this time learning the basics of mathematics.If i learn how to upload PDF files,then I will share a great deal of funny math handouts that i made myself.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been using a very good domestic LaTeX platform recently, and everyone is welcome to use it! <a href="https://app.loongtex.com/">LoongTeX</a></p>
